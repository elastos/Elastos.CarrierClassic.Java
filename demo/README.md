#### Start the Messenger demo

Note: For easy access, it is recommended to move the previously generated messenger.jar file to a different location.
Create a new folder and place the .jar file inside. When running the application, it will create two additional folders.
**The messenger.jar file must be started from the terminal.**

Open a new terminal.

Execute the command where the messenger.jar file has been placed:
```
$ java -jar messenger.jar
```

The messenger application will start and a new address will be automatically created.
The loading indicator will disappear when the node has successfully joined the network.

Note: Please do not close the terminal in the background when the messenger is running.
It is technically possible to hide it, but currently it may be used for debugging.
